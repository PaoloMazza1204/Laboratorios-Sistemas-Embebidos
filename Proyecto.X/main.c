    pvPortMalloc() is called internally by the kernel whenever a task, queue,
    timer or semaphore is created.  It is also called by various parts of the
    demo application.  If heap_1.c or heap_2.c are used, then the size of the
    heap available to pvPortMalloc() is defined by configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE in
    FreeRTOSConfig.h, and the xPortGetFreeHeapSize() API function can be used
    to query the size of free heap space that remains (although it does not

    to block in any way (for example, call xQueueReceive() with a block time
    specified, or call vTaskDelay()).  If the application makes use of the
    vTaskDelete() API function (as this demo application does) then it is also
    important that vApplicationIdleHook() is permitted to return to its calling
    function, because it is the responsibility of the idle task to clean up
